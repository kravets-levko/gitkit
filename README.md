# GitKit

GitKit is a simple and powerful web interface for interacting with multiple git repositories. 
It allows to manage repositories, view files, commits, branches, tags, and do almost
everything you may need to do with your repositories.

GitKit is built on top of [Slim](https://www.slimframework.com/) PHP microframework and
requires PHP 7 to run. GitKit uses [Twig](https://twig.symfony.com/) templating engine with
[Bootstrap 4](https://getbootstrap.com/) - it means that GitKit is very easy to customize.
